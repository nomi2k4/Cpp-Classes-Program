C++ Classes Program

Description
This C++ program demonstrates the use of classes and objects to represent different entities: Car, Book, Product, and BankAccount. It showcases how to define classes with attributes and methods, create objects, and interact with them.

Features
-   Defines classes for Car, Book, Product, and BankAccount.
-   Each class has its own attributes (e.g., Car has make, model, year, color)[cite: 38, 109, 1, 67].
-   Each class has methods to get and set the values of its attributes[cite: 18, 19, 20, 54, 55, 56, 57, 74, 75, 76, 77, 95, 96, 97, 98].
-   Demonstrates how to create objects of these classes.
-   Demonstrates how to use the methods to modify and display object data[cite: 39, 40, 41, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50].

Code Structure
The code consists of the following files:

-   `g.cpp`: Contains the main function, which demonstrates the usage of the Car, Book, Product, and BankAccount classes[cite: 38, 39, 40, 41, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50].
-   `e.cpp` and `f.cpp`: Define and implement the Car class[cite: 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 60, 61, 67].
-   `c.cpp` and `d.cpp`: Define and implement the Book class[cite: 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 80, 81, 88].
-   `h.cpp` and `i.cpp`: Define and implement the Product class[cite: 17, 18, 19, 20, 24, 25, 32, 35].
-   `a.cpp` and `b.cpp`: Define and implement the BankAccount class[cite: 101, 102, 109, 112].

Dependencies
-   iostream: For input/output operations[cite: 35, 67, 88, 109, 112].
-   string: For handling string data[cite: 35, 67, 88, 109, 112].

Compilation and Execution
To compile and run the program, save the files with a .cpp extension (e.g., main.cpp, car.cpp, book.cpp, product.cpp, account.cpp, and their respective header files) and use a C++ compiler.
